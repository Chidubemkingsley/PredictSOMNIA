## 🔐 Security Validation

### ReentrancyGuard Protection
- ✅ All state-modifying functions protected
- ✅ Prevents reentrancy attacks on:
  - buyPosition()
  - claimWinnings()
  - withdrawPlatformFees()

### Access Control
- ✅ Ownable pattern implemented
- ✅ Oracle authorization system functional
- ✅ Unauthorized access properly rejected

### Input Validation
- ✅ Zero address checks
- ✅ Deadline validation (must be future)
- ✅ Question string validation (non-empty)
- ✅ Bet amount validation (> 0)

### State Management
- ✅ Market resolution prevents further bets
- ✅ Double-claim prevention working
- ✅ Platform fee properly tracked

2. Implement configurable platform fee
3. Add emergency pause functionality
4. Create dispute resolution mechanism
5. Add timelock for admin operations
6. Implement governance for oracle management

- **Network:** Hardhat Local (ephemeral)
- **Accounts:** 10 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
- **Block Time:** Instant (no mining delay)
- **Forking:** None (pure local testing)
